        Five soon-to-be data scientists, a deserted UAS campus and a zombie
        pandemic that is spreading faster than the rumours in the canteen
        queue - great. With more caffeine than hope and a pinch of sheer
        desperation, the five of them set off in search of a vaccine while the
        undead impatiently wait outside for their next brainy snack. Between
        countless CSV files, heated discussions about the ethical boundaries
        of substance abuse and animal testing (Do we REALLY think, that
        zombies are suitable test subjects?) and the desperate hunt for the
        last packet of instant noodles, it soon becomes clear that this is no
        ordinary research project.

          <p>
            A virus that spreads like wildfire, an algorithm that barely keeps up, and a country map that now looks more
            like a doomsday simulation—fantastic.
            With color-coded heatmaps, outdated infection models and a growing sense of impending doom, we watched as
            red zones swallow familiar places.
            Upper Austria? Overrun. Vienna? A lost cause. Our own lab? A flickering green dot in a sea of danger—at
            least, for now.
            While we scramble to refine our projections (and argue over whether the zombies move in random walks or
            follow predictive patterns), one thing is certain:
            if our model is right, we’re running out of time.

              The data scientists in the lab sat in front of their screens -
              surrounded by coffee cups, empty pizza boxes and a whiteboard
              full of arrows, numbers and desperate notes. They hunted through
              endless tables of test subjects' vital signs, looking for
              patterns - and lo and behold, infected people not only had a
              significantly higher body temperature, but also alarmingly high
              blood pressure. ‘No wonder they're so aggressive - they're
              basically walking espresso machines!’ someone exclaimed, while
              another drew a wild curve on a graph. Between heart rate
              analyses and heated discussions about zombie metabolism, it
              slowly became clear how the virus could be specifically slowed
              down.

          <h2>How we get the vaccine?</h2>
          <p>
            In the chaos of a zombie outbreak, our lab transformed into a high-stakes arena where every second counted.
            With little more than caffeine-fueled determination and a mountain of messy data,
            our team of unlikely heroes embarked on a mission: to create the vaccine that could finally put an end to
            the madness.
            Our journey began by examining each core ingredient of the cure.
            Tiny yet powerful yeast kickstarts fermentation, while vast culture media fuel the process.
            Specialized chromatography and filtration purify every drop, and the perfect amount of syringes and
            packaging ensure hope reaches every corner.

            <p>
              This bar chart shows the potential number of vaccine doses that can be produced from each ingredient.
              Each bar represents an ingredient's capacity—calculated by comparing the available quantity with the
              amount
              required for 100 doses.
              The orange bar marks the bottleneck, the ingredient that limits production. In our case, "Culture media"
              produces the fewest doses, capping the overall output.

        <p>
          As soon as the vaccine was ready, the trucks started their
          engines: in a mixture of scientific precision and pure panic, the
          promising doses of freshly brewed healthy-juice were loaded into
          trucks that sped off campus with squealing tyres. With an
          ingenious distribution system that was was about as chaotic as a
          cleaning plan discussion in a shared appartment, but somehow
          somehow worked, they brought the saving syringe to every corner of
          Austria. Motorways became high-speed delivery routes, improvised
          drop-off points were established in the remaining safe zones and
          thanks to a few courageous scientists with racing ambitions, the
          vaccine was in circulation faster than the latest university
          gossip.

        <h2>Needles to say: We're cured!</h2>
        <p>
          In the following days, the cure was distributed from the safezones
          to the surrounding areas. Due to the rather unfortunate fact that
          the cure had to be injected using comically large syringes, many
          people bailed and tried to flee the country but were quickly
          stopped by the military base of Austria´s neighbouring countries.
          There are still areas that are not fully cured, especially Vienna
          and many areas in the north of the country. Vienna is especially
          hard to get to because the remaining rebels use to ruins of the
          city (Thanks for bombing Vienna, General...) to effectively keep
          out unwanted visitors. But the team is certain that in the
          following days the last infected people will be cured. They were
          last seen carrying the remaining yeast to their local brewery.
